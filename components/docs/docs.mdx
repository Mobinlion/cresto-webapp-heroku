## How to use

### Setup

Install it:

```bash
npm install --save next react react-dom
```

and add a script to your package.json like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

After that, the file-system is the main API. Every `.js` file becomes a route that gets automatically processed and rendered.

Populate `./pages/index.js` inside your project:

```jsx
export default () => <div>Welcome to next.js!</div>;
```

and then just run `npm run dev` and go to `http://localhost:3000`. To use another port, you can run `npm run dev -- -p <your port here>`.

So far, we get:

- Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
- Hot code reloading
- Server rendering and indexing of `./pages`
- Static file serving. `./static/` is mapped to `/static/` (given you [create a `./static/` directory](#static-file-serving-eg-images) inside your project)

To see how simple this is, check out the [sample app - nextgram](https://github.com/zeit/nextgram)

### Automatic code splitting

Every `import` you declare gets bundled and served with each page. That means pages never load unnecessary code!

```jsx
import cowsay from "cowsay-browser";

export default () => <pre>{cowsay.say({ text: "hi there!" })}</pre>;
```

### CSS

#### Built-in CSS support

  <summary>
    <b>Examples</b>
  </summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" href="/examples/basic-css">
        Basic css
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

We bundle [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) to provide support for isolated scoped CSS. The aim is to support "shadow CSS" similar to Web Components, which unfortunately [do not support server-rendering and are JS-only](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/71).

```jsx
export default () => (
  <div>
    Hello world
    <p>scoped!</p>
    <style jsx>{`
      p {
        color: blue;
      }
      div {
        background: red;
      }
      @media (max-width: 600px) {
        div {
          background: blue;
        }
      }
    `}</style>
    <style global jsx>{`
      body {
        background: black;
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
);
```

Please see the [styled-jsx documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-jsx) for more examples.

It's possible to use any existing CSS-in-JS solution. The simplest one is inline styles:

```jsx
export default () => <p style={{ color: "red" }}>hi there</p>;
```

To use more sophisticated CSS-in-JS solutions, you typically have to implement style flushing for server-side rendering. We enable this by allowing you to define your own [custom `<Document>`](#user-content-custom-document) component that wraps each page.

#### Importing CSS / Sass / Less / Stylus files

To support importing `.css`, `.scss`, `.less` or `.styl` files you can use these modules, which configure sensible defaults for server rendered applications.

- [@zeit/next-css](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-css)
- [@zeit/next-sass](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-sass)
- [@zeit/next-less](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-less)
- [@zeit/next-stylus](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-stylus)

### Static file serving (e.g.: images)

Create a folder called `static` in your project root directory. From your code you can then reference those files with `/static/` URLs:

```jsx
export default () => <img src="/static/my-image.png" alt="my image" />;
```

_Note: Don't name the `static` directory anything else. The name is required and is the only directory that Next.js uses for serving static assets._

### Populating `<head>`

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Examples</b>
  </summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" href="/examples/head-elements">
        Head elements
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" href="/examples/layout-component">
        Layout component
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

We expose a built-in component for appending elements to the `<head>` of the page.

```jsx
import Head from "next/head";

export default () => (
  <div>
    <Head>
      <title>My page title</title>
      <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
    </Head>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </div>
);
```

To avoid duplicate tags in your `<head>` you can use the `key` property, which will make sure the tag is only rendered once:

```jsx
import Head from "next/head";

export default () => (
  <div>
    <Head>
      <title>My page title</title>
      <meta
        name="viewport"
        content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width"
        key="viewport"
      />
    </Head>
    <Head>
      <meta
        name="viewport"
        content="initial-scale=1.2, width=device-width"
        key="viewport"
      />
    </Head>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </div>
);
```

In this case only the second `<meta name="viewport" />` is rendered.

_Note: The contents of `<head>` get cleared upon unmounting the component, so make sure each page completely defines what it needs in `<head>`, without making assumptions about what other pages added_

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Is this production ready?</summary>
  Next.js has been powering https://zeit.co since its inception.

We’re ecstatic about both the developer experience and end-user performance, so we decided to share it with the community.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How big is it?</summary>

The client side bundle size should be measured in a per-app basis.
A small Next main bundle is around 65kb gzipped.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is this like `create-react-app`?</summary>

Yes and No.

Yes in that both make your life easier.

No in that it enforces a _structure_ so that we can do more advanced things like:

- Server side rendering
- Automatic code splitting

In addition, Next.js provides two built-in features that are critical for every single website:

- Routing with lazy component loading: `<Link>` (by importing `next/link`)
- A way for components to alter `<head>`: `<Head>` (by importing `next/head`)

If you want to create re-usable React components that you can embed in your Next.js app or other React applications, using `create-react-app` is a great idea. You can later `import` it and keep your codebase clean!

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I use CSS-in-JS solutions?</summary>

Next.js bundles [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) supporting scoped css. However you can use any CSS-in-JS solution in your Next app by just including your favorite library [as mentioned before](#css-in-js) in the document.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What syntactic features are transpiled? How do I change them?</summary>

We track V8. Since V8 has wide support for ES6 and `async` and `await`, we transpile those. Since V8 doesn’t support class decorators, we don’t transpile those.

See the documentation about [customizing the babel config](#customizing-babel-config) and [next/preset](./build/babel/preset.js) for more information.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why a new Router?</summary>

Next.js is special in that:

- Routes don’t need to be known ahead of time
- Routes are always lazy-loadable
- Top-level components can define `getInitialProps` that should _block_ the loading of the route (either when server-rendering or lazy-loading)

As a result, we were able to introduce a very simple approach to routing that consists of two pieces:

- Every top level component receives a `url` object to inspect the url or perform modifications to the history
- A `<Link />` component is used to wrap elements like anchors (`<a/>`) to perform client-side transitions

We tested the flexibility of the routing with some interesting scenarios. For an example, check out [nextgram](https://github.com/zeit/nextgram).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I define a custom fancy route?</summary>

We [added](#custom-server-and-routing) the ability to map between an arbitrary URL and any component by supplying a request handler.

On the client side, we have a parameter call `as` on `<Link>` that _decorates_ the URL differently from the URL it _fetches_.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I fetch data?</summary>

It’s up to you. `getInitialProps` is an `async` function (or a regular function that returns a `Promise`). It can retrieve data from anywhere.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use it with GraphQL?</summary>

Yes! Here's an example with [Apollo](./examples/with-apollo).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use it with Redux?</summary>

Yes! Here's an [example](./examples/with-redux)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use Next with my favorite Javascript library or toolkit?</summary>

Since our first release we've had **many** example contributions, you can check them out in the [examples](./examples) directory

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is this inspired by?</summary>

Many of the goals we set out to accomplish were the ones listed in [The 7 principles of Rich Web Applications](http://rauchg.com/2014/7-principles-of-rich-web-applications/) by Guillermo Rauch.

The ease-of-use of PHP is a great inspiration. We feel Next.js is a suitable replacement for many scenarios where you otherwise would use PHP to output HTML.

Unlike PHP, we benefit from the ES6 module system and every file exports a **component or function** that can be easily imported for lazy evaluation or testing.

As we were researching options for server-rendering React that didn’t involve a large number of steps, we came across [react-page](https://github.com/facebookarchive/react-page) (now deprecated), a similar approach to Next.js by the creator of React Jordan Walke.
